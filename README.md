# Statistical-Calculator1
Objective:
Design and implement a C application that calculates various statistical measures and mathematical operations for a given set of numerical data. The program should provide a menu-driven interface for user interaction, allowing the selection of different functionalities.
________________________________________
Functional Requirements:
The application should support the following operations:
1.	Mean: Calculate the average of a set of numbers.
2.	Median: Determine the middle value of a sorted set of numbers.
3.	Mode: Identify the most frequently occurring number(s) in the set.
4.	Square Root: Compute the square root of a specified number.
5.	Variance and Standard Deviation: Calculate measures of data dispersion.
6.	Sorting: Display the dataset in ascending order.
7.	Custom Operations: Allow additional mathematical operations, if feasible (e.g., sum, product, minimum, maximum).
________________________________________
User Interaction:
1.	The program should display a menu with all the available operations.
2.	The user should be prompted to enter their choice from the menu.
3.	Based on the selection, the program should:
○	Prompt the user for necessary inputs (e.g., dataset, specific number).
○	Perform the selected operation.
○	Display the result clearly.
________________________________________
Technical Requirements:
1.	Programming Language: The application must be developed in C.
2.	Input: Accept numeric data from the user (either as a single number or an array of numbers).
3.	Output: Display results to the console with proper formatting and labels.
4.	Error Handling: Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-numeric entries, empty datasets).
5.	Code Modularity: Use functions to encapsulate each operation for readability and maintainability.
6.	Sorting Algorithm: Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort or Quick Sort) for median and sorted output.
________________________________________
Constraints:
1.	The dataset size should not exceed 100 numbers.
2.	Use standard C libraries (e.g., <math.h> for mathematical functions).
3.	Avoid using external dependencies or libraries beyond standard C.
